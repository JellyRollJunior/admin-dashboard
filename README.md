# Learning outcomes
- Getting the hang of CSS Grid
  - Identifying grid layout/size. How to position items. When to declare grid size or let it be flexible with auto sizing
- Using background images
  - Declaring image in CSS vs HTML (I think I prefer declaring it in HTML since we can add an alt attribute and also keeps the CSS clear)
    - Declaring in CSS seems to be good for background images where no alt is needed
- Got to practice some flex - grid interactions.
  - Mostly tried to use grid because of the assignment but some areas made more sense to flex
- Practiced responsive design
  - Header + content will grow up until 1500px then it will center on screen
  - I think its pretty good for a first solution! Haven't learned about responsive design explicitly yet but a good start.
- How to use linear-gradient to create stripes
